### Welcome to Hadoop Auto Install

Description: This script will help you automate Hadoop installation on your Ubuntu machine. Currently it has been tested on Ubuntu v11.04 & v11.10.

How to use: Before starting you need ip addresses of you master & slaves machines. This information have to be saved in hadoop_install.conf file, You can use the default content in file to add your machines ips (Just change the ips).
Copy both of these files on to each machine and make hadoop_install.sh executable by changing its executable permission (sudo chmod +x hadoop_install.sh) and execute it by ./hadoop_install.sh.
Select type of the machine that you want it to eg: master or slave and let it finish.
You can view the installation log in /tmp/hadoop_install.log file.

Note: This will download apache hadoop zip file from apache server (size: approx. 55 MB), Additionally you can change other small params like hadoop user account name, hadoop file version to download, etc in hadoop_install.sh (Only for expert users)

Please post if you face any problem or need additional help.
